Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme for secp256k1 in Rust, based on [pure Rust implementation](https://github.com/paritytech/libsecp256k1) of secp256k1.

ECIES functionalities are built upon AES-GCM-256 and HKDF-SHA256.

This is the Rust version of [eciespy](https://github.com/ecies/py).

This library can be compiled to the WASM target at your option, see [WASM compatibility](#wasm-compatibility).

## Quick Start

```rust
use ecies::{decrypt, encrypt, utils::generate_keypair};

const MSG: &str = "helloworld";
let (sk, pk) = generate_keypair();
let (sk, pk) = (&sk.serialize(), &pk.serialize());

let msg = MSG.as_bytes();
assert_eq!(
    msg,
    decrypt(sk, &encrypt(pk, msg).unwrap()).unwrap().as_slice()
);
```

## Optional pure Rust AES backend

You can choose to use OpenSSL implementation or [pure Rust implementation](https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs) of AES-256-GCM:

```toml
ecies = {version = "0.2", default-features = false, features = ["pure"]}
```

Due to some [performance problem](https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs/issues/243), OpenSSL is the default backend.

Pure Rust implementation is sometimes useful, such as building on WASM:

```bash
cargo build --no-default-features --features pure --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

If you select the pure Rust backend on modern CPUs, consider building with

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-Ctarget-cpu=sandybridge -Ctarget-feature=+aes,+sse2,+sse4.1,+ssse3"
```

to speed up AES encryption/decryption. This would be no longer necessary when [`aes-gcm` supports automatic CPU detection](https://github.com/RustCrypto/AEADs/issues/243#issuecomment-738821935).

## WASM compatibility

It's also possible to build to the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target with the pure Rust backend. Check out [this repo](https://github.com/ecies/rs-wasm) for more details.

## Security

### Why AES-GCM-256 and HKDF-SHA256

AEAD scheme like AES-GCM-256 should be your first option for symmetric ciphers, with unique IVs in each encryption.

For key derivation functions on shared points between two asymmetric keys, HKDFs are [proven](https://github.com/ecies/py/issues/82) to be more secure than simple hash functions like SHA256.

### Cross-language compatibility

All functionalities are mutually checked among [different languages](https://github.com/ecies): Python, Rust, JavaScript and Golang.

### Security audit

Following dependencies are audited:

- [aes-gcm](https://research.nccgroup.com/2020/02/26/public-report-rustcrypto-aes-gcm-and-chacha20poly1305-implementation-review/)
- [OpenSSL](https://ostif.org/the-ostif-and-quarkslab-audit-of-openssl-is-complete/)

## Benchmark

The result shows that the pure Rust backend is around 20% ~ 50% slower compared to OpenSSL on MacBook Pro mid-2015 (2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7).

```

## Configuration

You can enable 12 bytes nonce by specify `aes_12bytes_nonce` feature.

```toml
ecies = {version = "0.2", default-features = false, features = ["aes_12bytes_nonce"]}
```

Other behaviors can be configured by global static variable:

```rs
pub struct Config {
    pub is_ephemeral_key_compressed: bool,
    pub is_hkdf_key_compressed: bool,
    pub symmetric_algorithm: SymmetricAlgorithm,
}
```

If you set `is_ephemeral_key_compressed: true`, the payload would be like: `33 Bytes + AES` instead of `65 Bytes + AES`.

If you set `is_hkdf_key_compressed: true`, the hkdf key would be derived from `ephemeral public key (compressed) + shared public key (compressed)` instead of `ephemeral public key (uncompressed) + shared public key (uncompressed)`.

```rs
update_config(Config {
    is_ephemeral_key_compressed: true,
    is_hkdf_key_compressed: true,
    ..Config::default()
});
```

For compatibility, make sure different applications share the same configuration.
